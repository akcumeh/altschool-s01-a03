        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <p>Fried rice is easy to make, the real work is in preparing all the sides and addditions that go into the meal.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cut your carrots, spring onions, bell peppers, runner beans, and other veggies into your preferred
                bite-sized shapes. Try making your carrots, bell peppers and tomatoes into slim slices, or into small
                cubes, however you prefer.</li>
            <li>You can prepare your protein using any desired method but make sure to keep the broth, e.g. you may
                choose to boil your chicken, or fry it. If you are using side protein as well (e.g. boiled liver, or
                fried beef pieces), prepare it and keep the broth. I would recommend seasoning your chicken with:
                <ul>
                    <li>one finely diced onion</li>
                    <li>2-3 diced peppers</li>
                    <li>&frac12; tbsp thyme</li>
                    <li>&frac12; tbsp curry powder</li>
                    <li>1 bouillon cube</li>
                    <li>Salt & *black pepper to taste.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>With the bulk of the work out of the way, let's get to actually preparing the dish.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Parboil and wash your rice.</li>
            <li>Add the broth to the rice (ideally it should not cover the rice so it doesn't get too soft, but this
                depends on the texture of the rice after parboiling and washing). Add 1 tbsp curry powder, *&frac12;
                tbsp turmeric powder or grated turmeric, one bouillon cube and salt to taste. Let it cook for 10-15
                minutes on medium heat, or until the water is almost dried up.</li>
            <br>
            From this point onwards, the food will be made in batches. It takes 4-6 batches to finish the amount of food
            prepared. You will also need to work quickly.
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>In a large pan, add 2tbsp oil and heat it on medium heat for a minute.</li>
            <li>Starting with the toughest veggies and working down (i.e. in this order: carrots, runner beans, bell
                peppers, peas, onions, spring onions, sweetcorn, etc), add a portion to the oil and stir for 45-60
                seconds each. Bring down the heat to low and add the sausages & side protein(s) last, if any.</li>
            <li>Taste the rice, if it needs more salt, you can add salt and black pepper powder to the mix in the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Add a portion of the rice to the pan, add the tomato slices if any, and carefully mix the ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>Keep repeating steps 3-6 until the rice and all other ingredients are finished.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This recipe has evolved and improved a lot since I first saw <a
               href="https://allnigerianfoods.com/nigerian-fried-rice/">this version</a> in 2017. I have made many
            spin-offs of it as well, including egg fried rice and shrimp fried rice.</p>
